# 09-FPS
The hastily-assembled FPS shooter in Godot for C220- Game Technology.

As I mostly rushed to get this done, I only implemented what my instructor, Jason Francis did, in his screencast showing of how to set this all up, with some minor alterations (text dialogue for game over screen, instructions, etc), and so they're very much similar.

Thinking of updating this in the future with different textures and models, and adding music later on as well.
